# domjsx: Simply DOM + JSX

domjsx is a javascript framework that lets you create fast and interactive web applications with minimal code. domjsx is close to vanilla javascript, includes a virtual dom for initial rendering and jsx, and feels quite familiar if you've written vanilla javascript before.

## Features

-   **Simple and intuitive**: domjsx uses jsx syntax and a component-based architecture to make your code easy to read and write.
-   **Fast and efficient**: All dom updates in domjsx are manual so your app has no overhead, making it blazing fast and responsive.
-   **Flexible and compatible**: domjsx works with any vanilla frontend library, and can be easily integrated with existing projects.
