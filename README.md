# Jolt: Javascript Optimal Lightweight Templater

Jolt is a javascript framework that lets you create fast and interactive web applications with minimal code. Jolt is close to vanilla javascript, includes a virtual dom for initial rendering and jsx, and feels quite familiar if you've written vanilla javascript before.

## Features

- **Simple and intuitive**: Jolt uses jsx syntax and a component-based architecture to make your code easy to read and write.
- **Fast and efficient**: All dom updates in Jolt are manual so your app has no overhead, making it blazing fast and responsive.
- **Flexible and compatible**: Jolt works with any vanilla frontend library, and can be easily integrated with existing projects.

## Installation

To install Jolt, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install jolt
```
